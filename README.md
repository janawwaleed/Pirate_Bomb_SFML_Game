# SFML Game Project

This is a 2D game created as part of the Structured Programming course in our first year at Ain Shams University. The game is built using C++ and the SFML library, focusing on structured programming main concepts such as structs, functions, arrays and dynamic arrays. The game also implements some basic OOP concepts.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: SFML
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Community

### Features

- Real-time graphics and animations using SFML.
- Simple gameplay mechanics that demonstrate the use of structured programming principles such as:
  - Control structures (loops, conditionals).
  - Functions.
  - Structs.
- Physics:
  - projectile motion
  - gravity
  - collisions
  - resistance force
